## **Overview**

This project is a beginner-level SQL practice exercise where I created and worked with a sample retail sales database. The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of database setup, data cleaning, and writing SQL queries for basic data retrieval and reporting.

**Objectives**
-Create and manage a sample SQL database.
-Practice data cleaning techniques (handling NULL values, removing invalid records).
-Write SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and summarize data.
-Improve understanding of SQL fundamentals useful for database management and support tasks.

**Project Structure**
1. Database Setup
-Created a database p1_retail_db.
-Defined a table retail_sales with columns for transaction ID, sale date, customer details, category, and sales amounts.

2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
-Counted total records and unique customers.
-Checked for NULL values and removed incomplete records.

3. SQL Practice Queries
-Retrieve sales data for a specific date.
-Filter transactions by category and quantity.
-Calculate total and average sales for categories.
-Identify high-value transactions.
-Count unique customers per category.

**Key Learnings**
-Gained hands-on practice with SQL basics: CREATE, INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, UPDATE, GROUP BY.
-Learned how to clean datasets using SQL.
-Improved skills in writing queries for data summarization and simple reporting.

**How to Use**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the SQL scripts in your preferred database system (MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle).
3. Modify or extend the queries for further practice.

**Conclusion**

This project helped me practice essential SQL concepts such as database creation, data cleaning, and writing queries to explore and summarize data. These skills are directly useful in system administration and support roles where handling databases and writing basic queries is often required.
